Option   Meaning
-A       All warnings will be active.
-ansic   Disallow the language extensions of lcc-win32.
-ansic90 Conform to ANSI 1990 standard. This option will disallow all C99
         and link with crtdll.dll, the C90 standard linbrary. Long long
         support doesn't exist, there is no optimizer, but programs are
         30K smaller than C99 programs. Use the driver "lc.exe" for this
         option. Note that // comments are NOT recognized if you use this
         option.
-D       Define the symbol following the D. Example:-DNODEBUG The symbol
         NODEBUG is defined. Note: NO space between the D and the symbol
-dd      Debug defines. This option will write in the standard output a list
         of all preprocessor defines followed by the file name and line number
         where they are defined. This allows to see which definition is used.
-check   Check the given source for errors. No object file is generated.
-E       Generate an intermediate file with the output of the preprocessor.
         The output file name will be deduced from the input file name, i.e.,
         for a compilation of foo.c you will obtain foo.i.
-E+      Like the -E option, but instead of generating a #line xxx directive,
         the preprocessor generates a # xxx directive.
-EP      Like the -E option, but no #line directives will be generated.
-errout= Append the warning/error messages to the indicated file.
         Example -errout=Myexe.err. This will append to Myexe.err all
         warnings and error messages.
-eN      Set the maximum error count to N. Example:-e25.
-fno-inline The inline directive is ignored.
-Fo<file name> This forces the name of the output file.
-g2      Generate the debugging information.
-g3      Arrange for function stack tracing. If a trap occurs, the function
         stack will be displayed.
-g4      Arrange for function stack and line number tracing.
-g5      Arrange for function stack, line number, and return call stack
         corruption tracing.
-I       Add a path to the path included, i.e. to the path the compiler follows
         to find the header files. Example:-Ic:\project\headers. Note NO space
         between the I and the following path.
-libcdll Use declarations for lcclibc.dll.Files compiled with this option
         should use the -dynamic option of the linker lcclnk.
-M       Print in standard output the names of all files that the preprocessor
         has opened when processing the given input file. No object file is
         generated.
-M1      Print in standard output each include file recursively, indicating
         where it is called from, and when it is closed.
-nw      No warnings will be emitted. Errors will be still printed.
-O       Optimize the output. This activates the peephole optimizer.
-o <file>Use as the name of the output file the given name. Identical to the
         Fo flag above.
-overflowcheck
         Generate code to test for overflow for all additions, subtractions and
         multiplications.
-p6      Enable SSE3 instructions
-p6=no   Disable SSE3 instructions
-profile Inject code into the generated program to measure execution time.
         This option is incompatible with debug level higher than 2.
-S       Generate an assembly file. The output file name will be deduced from
         the input file: for a compilation of foo.c you will obtain foo.asm.
-s n     Set the switch density to n that must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
         Example: -s 0.1
-shadows Warn when a local variable shadows a global one.
-stackinit n
         Initialize the uninitialized stack at function entry with a value "n". 
-U       Undefine the symbol following the U.
-unused  Warns about unused assignments and suppresses the dead code.
-v       Show compiler version and compilation date
-z       Generate a file with the intermediate language of lcc. The name of the
         generated file will have a .lil extension.
-Zp[1,2,4,8,16] Set the default alignment in structures to one, two, four, etc.
        If you set it to one, this actually means no alignment at all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command line options are case sensitive. Use either "-" or "/" to
introduce an option in the command line.
The compiler detects the type of machine used and will set the p6 flag automatically. Use
the p6 flags in case you want to override detection.
